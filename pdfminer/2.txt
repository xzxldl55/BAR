Revising, as a fundamental component process of written text production, has drawn
extensive research attention in second language (L2) writing. While most studies exam-
ined revisions through sociolinguistic categories to understand how revisions cognitively
load on L2 writers, further studies need to quantify the cognitive deployment of atten-
tional resources during revising. Using Inputlog6.0, this study investigated the online re-
visions of 57 Chinese EFL writers at the more- and less-skilled writing levels. Online
revisions were ﬁrst divided into immediate, distant and end revisions according to their
temporospatial locations, and then examined in terms of frequency, scope, duration, dis-
tance and in relation to the ﬁnal text quality. Data analysis revealed that less-skilled L2
writers revised more frequently but on smaller scopes in immediate and distant revisions,
while more-skilled L2 writers revised more frequently and on larger scopes in end re-
visions. The text quality correlated negatively with the frequencies of immediate and
distant revisions, yet positively with the scopes of all three types of online revisions and
with all four dimensions of end revisions. These ﬁndings suggest that, while writing is a
recursive process when different component processes interact, L2 writers beneﬁt from a
focused production process scaffolded by in-depth and extensive revising processes.

1. Introduction

Writing has been recognized as a complex cognitive process, during which various sub-processes, i.e., planning, trans-
lating/formulating and revising (Hayes, 2012; Hayes & Flower, 1980; Roca de Larios, Manchon, & Murphy, 2006; Xu, 2017),
cognitively load on the writer's working memory and consequently affect the written product emerging from these sub-
processes. The Kellogg (1996) working memory model of writing posits that written language production draws on a sin-
gle, limited pool of attentional resources, with different writing processes competing for attentional resources under the
constraints of a central executive. Shall the attentional resources be exceeded, some processes of writing would be suspended
or sacriﬁced to accommodate the immediate call for other processes (DeKeyser, 2001; Roca de Larios et al., 2006), giving rise
to process alternation, suspension or termination during writing.
Revising is a process when text production is suspended or terminated for the reﬂection and/or transformation of the
produced text (Van den Bergh, Rijlaarsdam, & Breetvelt, 1994). It signals the interaction and alternation of component writing
processes and consequently, the allocation of attentional resources during writing. Research into revising thus promises
insights into L2 writers' management of their writing processes and how effective such process management turns out in

their ﬁnal texts. As “learning to revise is essential for learning to improve one's writing” (Beach, 1992, p. vii), understanding
revising is pedagogically crucial for the creation and development of quality writing.
A number of studies have investigated L2 online revisions in pen-and-paper writing settings through think-aloud pro-
tocols, video-recordings or post-task interviews. These studies, by comparing L2 writing against L1 writing or focusing on L2
writing, promote knowledge of L2 online revisions regarding whether L2 writers' attention to local issues would impede that
to global ones and whether L2 writing proﬁciency affects what writers attend to revise (Chenoweth & Hayes, 2001; Roca de
Larios, Marín, & Murphy, 2001; Roca de Larios, Manchon, & Marín, 2008). This sociolinguistic categorization of online re-
visions also sheds light on how revisions of different categories cognitively load on L2 writers’ attentional resources (Dix,
2006; Kobayashi & Rinnert, 2001). However, the connection between revision categories and their cognitive load on work-
ing memory needs to be ﬁne-grained for precision, and some observations from case studies need to be conﬁrmed with
enlarged samples.
With computer rising to be the main medium for academic writing, the concepts of drafting and revising have changed in
the word processor. As writers are now able to produce a clean text while revising at anytime and anywhere during its
production, revising in computer keyboard settings expects to witness new features against those observed in pen-and-paper
settings and thus calls for new research efforts (Barkaoui, 2016; Dave & Russell, 2010; Ganem-Gutierrez & Gilmore, 2018). The
development of computer keystroke logging programs also promises ﬁne-grained and large-scaled investigation into the
writing process (Abdel Latif, 2008; Leijten & Van Waes, 2013; Xu & Qi, 2017). Consequently, revision studies have moved onto
the more dynamic aspects of writing, i.e., revision point and revision duration, to denote how the revising process interacts
and intervenes with the production process (Barkaoui, 2016; Ganem-Gutierrez & Gilmore, 2018; Stevenson, Schoonen, & de
Glopper, 2006). Along this line, the revision taxonomy should integrate revision distance and revision duration to denote how
far an L2 writer's focal attention is moved away from the production point and how a revising event temporally loads on the
working memory. Meanwhile, as computer logging programs help record and sort different writing activities automatically at
high levels of accuracy, enlarged samples could be accommodated in online revision studies to better understand L2 writing
processes.
Of particular interest to this study was how differently more- and less-skilled L2 writers manage their online revisions in
computer keyboard writing settings. With a ﬁne-grained revision taxonomy enabled by Inputlog6.0 (Leijten & Van Waes,
2013), this study contributed to the literature by examining L2 writers’ online revisions in continuums of frequency, scope,
distance and duration at the more- and less-skilled writing levels, and how these online revisions related to the ﬁnal text
quality.

2. Related studies

2.1. L2 writing proﬁciency and online revisions

Many studies investigated how language proﬁciency affected the revising process by comparing writing in L2 against that
in L1 under the assumption that L2 writers would experience more frequent lack of language proﬁciency. With scope and
frequency being the major dimensions for online revisions, writers were found to revise more frequently in L2 than in L1
(Chenoweth & Hayes, 2001; Roca de Larios et al., 2006). Compared with L1 writing, L2 writing observed more frequent re-
visions on small scopes, i.e., more revisions at the linguistic level than at the discourse level (Chenoweth & Hayes, 2001;
Stevenson et al., 2006; Thorson, 2000), leading to the inhibition hypothesis that attention to low-level revisions would
impede attention to high-level ones in L2 writing (see Stevenson et al., 2006).
L2 writing researchers, mainly through case studies, strived to explore what speciﬁcally affected the L2 revising process,
with L2 writing proﬁciency being repeatedly identiﬁed as an important predictor for revising behaviors. Zamel (1983),
through the observation and interview of six advanced ESL students, found that while skilled L2 writers deferred lexical and
grammatical revisions until the ﬁnal stages of the composition process, the unskilled L2 writer “was distracted by local
problems from the very beginning (p. 174)” and revised words or phrases that barely affected meaning. Similarly, Broekkamp
and van den Bergh (1996) argued that low L2 proﬁciency could induce a heavy linguistic processing load on the working
memory, which consequently affected what, when and how frequently L2 writers chose to revise during production. By
examining the episode frequency and duration of L2 writing processes, Ganem-Gutierrez and Gilmore (2018) also reported a
signiﬁcant effect of L2 proﬁciency on the episode frequency of different writing processes and that more-proﬁcient students
allocated higher percentages of their writing episodes to revising than did their less-proﬁcient peers.
Different from previous ﬁndings on how L2 writing proﬁciency affected L2 revising strategies and consequently L2 revising
activities, Chenoweth and Hayes (2001) found, in a study on writing ﬂuency in L1 and L2, that more proﬁcient L2 writers
(learning an L2 for the ﬁfth/sixth semester) did not revise much as less proﬁcient L2 writers (learning the L2 for the third
semester). The researchers reasoned that proﬁcient L2 writers produced more linguistically correct texts that virtually
required less revisions. However, Roca de Larios et al. (2001, 2006) reported that increased L2 proﬁciency led to more re-
visions by examining the temporal distribution of the L1 and L2 formulation processes through think-aloud protocols. Much
of the revision effort was found to focus more on discovering better meaning-form matches than compensating for lack of
language proﬁciency, suggesting a linguistic concern beyond grammatical correctness for the more proﬁcient L2 writers. In
addition, Roca de Larios et al. (2008), in a study on EFL writers’ strategic allocation of writing time, found that increased L2
proﬁciency was observed with increased time investment in the revising process and other writing processes than the

106

C. Xu / System 78 (2018) 104e114

formulation process, further suggesting the strategic allocation of more time to online revisions among more proﬁcient L2
writers. Thus, more studies are in need to understand the relationship between L2 proﬁciency and L2 revising processes for
possible pedagogical interventions for L2 writers at different proﬁciency levels.
As previous studies suggest timing could be an important dimension to distinguish online revisions for L2 writers at
different proﬁciency levels (Roca de Larios et al., 2006; Van Waes & Schellens, 2003), more recent studies probe into the
temporal dimension of revising through computer logging programs. With computer logging ﬁles denoting the writing
process with great detail, revisions are further examined according to the revision point against the production point, with
the revision point either overlapping or being away from the production point (Barkaoui, 2016; Stevenson et al., 2006;
Thorson, 2000). Despite different terminologies in these studies, timing is an essential underlying criterion for such revi-
sion categorization, be it before, immediately after or some time after the transcription of ideas.
Along this line, Thorson (2000), through keystroke-logging and video-recordings, deﬁned online revision as interme-
diate revisions and distant revisions, i.e., with or without distance of letters between the cursor of production and the
revision point. The study reported that while L2 writing witnessed proportionately more revisions than L1 writing, L1 and
L2 writing did not differ signiﬁcantly in the ratio of distant revisions against total revisions, showing that language pro-
ﬁciency did not alter the interactive nature of writing. Using thinking-aloud protocols and keystroke-logging, Stevenson
et al. (2006) examined online revisions through a multi-dimensional revision taxonomy and found that while L2
writing generally displayed more revisions than L1 writing, there was little evidence for the inhibition of low-level re-
visions on high-level ones in L2 writing. Barkaoui (2016), in a cross-sectional study of the effects of L2 proﬁciency, com-
puter experience and writing task on the revising process, classiﬁed online revisions into pre-contextual and contextual
revisions on basis of whether the revision point overlapped with the production point. The study found that while L2
writers generally revised more on form than on content, L2 proﬁciency affected how L2 writers attended to different re-
visions in timed writing tasks and that less-skilled L2 writers made more pre-contextual revisions at the production point.
As the dichotomy of the revising point encodes rather limited information about how revising intervenes with production,
the revision taxonomy in computer-aided writing should be enriched to settle the inhibition controversies over the high-
and low-level revisions in L2 writing.

2.2. Revision taxonomies

2.2.1. Revision taxonomies developed from pen-and-paper writing
Informed by revision studies in pen-and-paper settings, online revisions also investigated revision frequency and revision
scope in computer keyboard writing (Barkaoui, 2016; Lindgren & Sullivan, 2006). Revision scope, often examined in
conjunction with revision frequency, denotes the aspects or scales of revisions from the sociocultural perspective, i.e., form/
meaning preserving/meaning changing revisions (New, 1999; Van Waes & Schellens, 2003), local/global/discourse revisions
(Kobayashi and Rinnert; 2001; Liang, 2010), content/organization/form revisions (Barkaoui, 2016; Stevenson et al., 2006), or
from the sociolinguistic perspective, i.e., revisions at lexical, phrasal and clausal levels (Barkaoui, 2016; Van Waes & Schellens,
2003). Revision frequency, usually examined together with revision scope, denotes how often a particular aspect of writing is
foregrounded in a writer's mind during revising and how often revising intervenes with production (Barkaoui, 2016; Dave &
Russell, 2010).
Behind the research efforts into revision scope and frequency is an ongoing quest to cognitively quantify on what
scope and how often L2 writers choose to revise for a better understanding of their management of attentional resources
during writing and how this management affects the ﬁnal text quality. However, previous ﬁndings on online revisions are
rather mixed from the cognitive perspective. Some reported that L2 writers revised most frequently at the local level,
with few revisions on the global level that affected the text meaning, suggesting a competition of attentional resources
between local and global issues during revising (Barkaoui, 2016; Chenoweth & Hayes, 2001; Dave & Russell, 2010). Other
studies, by comparing revisions in L1 and L2, found that although L2 writers revised more frequently at the linguistic
level, there was no evidence for the inhibition of low-level revisions on higher-level ones in L2 writing and that emphases
on local revisions did not impede the ﬂuent development of ideas in L2 writing (Lindgren & Sullivan, 2006; Spelman
Miller, Lindgren, & Sullivan, 2008; Stevenson et al., 2006). Furthermore, although increased L2 writing proﬁciency was
identiﬁed with more ﬂuent writing characterized by less revisions (Chenoweth & Hayes, 2001), disputes remained over
how revision frequency was related to the ﬁnal text quality. Recent studies suggested that revision frequency had little
bearings on L2 text quality (Spelman Miller et al., 2008; Stevenson et al., 2006), but previous studies in pen-and-paper
settings showed that good L2 writings witnessed less revisions during its production (Chenoweth & Hayes, 2001; Whalen
& Menard, 1995).
One reason for the mixed ﬁndings on revision scope and revision frequency could be the discrete measurement of re-
visions in categories instead of depicting revisions in continuums of various dimensions. On the one hand, the categorical
measurement of revisions helps understand the revising act in the sociolinguistic framework regarding how writing is
constructed and revised as calibrated by different linguistic units or changes at local versus global levels; on the other, it
leaves the cognitive load of each revising event on the working memory to rough estimation that the consumption of
attentional resources increases when revision scope climbs up categorically along the linguistic units or from local to global

issues. As “revisions made to long stretches of text can be considered to be revisions made at a higher level than revisions
made to words” (Stevenson et al., 2006, p. 205), it is possible, by measuring revision scope in continuum of letters, to un-
derstand more precisely on what scope each revision affects the text and what level of issues L2 writers attend to revise. The
numerical measurement of revision scope in letters shall help quantify the attentional resource each revision takes up to
better understand the revising process under the working memory model of writing.

2.2.2. Revision taxonomies emerging from computer-aided writing
With the advent of computer keyboard writing, a temporospatial dimension of online revisions, i.e., the revision point
against the production point, has been hierarchically integrated with revision frequency and revision scope to better
denote the revising process (Barkaoui, 2016; Lindgren & Sullivan, 2006; Stevenson et al., 2006; Thorson, 2000). As the
point of revision signals whether the writer's focal attention being shifted, both temporally and spatially, away from the
ongoing text production, these studies well inform L2 writing teachers and researchers of what concerns are fore-
grounded in L2 writers during their acts of revising. Nevertheless, the dichotomy of the revision points does not quantify
how far a revision point is away from the production point, i.e., revision distance, which is essential to understand how
much of the produced text that an L2 writer attempts to accommodate in a revising act. With keystroke logging pro-
grams, revision distance becomes more discernible in computer keyboard writing settings and thus promises more ﬁne-
grained measurement of the revising process.
In addition, previous studies showed that increased L2 proﬁciency tended to defer linguistic revisions to later stages of
writing (Zamel, 1983) and pre-contextual revisions occurred most in early stages of the writing while contextual revisions
happened much later (Barkaoui, 2016). Therefore, L2 writing proﬁciency could affect at what temporal stages attentional
resources would be spared for different revising activities. As revising under the pressure of further text production could load
quite differently on the working memory from revising after the main text production, the dichotomy of revising points
should be expanded to distinguish distant revisions for the accommodation of such differences. To further denote how L2
writers would prioritize their revising concerns at different stages of writing under Hayes and Flower's model of writing
processes (1980), this study proposed end revision to denote the revising efforts following the completion of the main text.
Thus, distant revision and end revision differed in whether further text production would follow the revising event, with
distant revision being followed by further text production while end revision being not. Incorporating the revision taxon-
omies from previous studies (Barkaoui, 2016; Thorson, 2000), this study thus sorted online revisions into three types, i.e.,
immediate, distant and end revisions.
Duration is another dynamic dimension of online revision that depicts the degree of effort investment from the temporal
perspective. A number of studies examined revision duration through verbal protocols or video-recorded writing sessions
(Olive, Kellogg, & Piolat, 2001; Roca de Larios et al., 2006; 2008). However, these studies focused on the temporal distribution
of different writing processes, with only brief reference to the revising process and much less about how different revisions
loaded on the working memory from the temporal perspective. As revision duration could better inform the ﬁeld about how
L2 writers managed their revision efforts temporally and hence their allocation of attentional resources during revising, it
should well be integrated into the existing revision taxonomy.

2.3. Unsettled issues and the current approach

To sum up, several issues need further research attention in L2 revision studies. First, the rise of computer as a
widespread writing medium has ushered in new features in the revising process and consequently ﬁne-grained measures
of online revisions are in need to depict the revising process in multi-dimensions and with great detail. Second, while
previous studies contribute profoundly to the understanding of revising in L2 writing, it remains unclear how L2 writers
at different skill levels manage online revisions and how this revision management relates to the ﬁnal text quality. Third,
as previous studies provide collective understandings of online revisions through different revision dimensions across
different groups of participants, it would help advance the knowledge of L2 writing if more dynamic dimensions of online
revisions can be examined in conjunction and within the same group of participants (Wollscheid, Sjaastad, & Tømte,
2016).
To gain further understanding of the revising process in L2 writing, this study employed Inputlog6.0 to log and analyze
how more- and less-skilled L2 writers differed in online revisions in computer keyboard writing settings. Online revisions
were divided into immediate, distant and end revisions and each type was examined in continuums of frequency, scope,
distance and duration and in how online revisions related to the ﬁnal text quality. Speciﬁcally, the study addressed the
following questions:

1. Do more- and less-skilled L2 writers differ in immediate, distant and end revisions in terms of frequency, scope, distance
and duration?1
2. How do online revisions relate to the ﬁnal text quality in L2 writing?

1 As immediate revisions virtually happened within one or 2 s at the point of text production, only frequency and scope were considered for immediate
revisions.

3. Methodology

3.1. Participants

C. Xu / System 78 (2018) 104e114

This study was conducted among a pool of 106 Chinese EFL learners at a Chinese university in 2015. The participants were
assigned into four English classes according to the alphabetical order of their Chinese names. They had 4 h of English per week
and had the same English teachers and English teaching materials since their entry into college. Data were collected during
their sophomore year, when they aged between 18 and 20 and had learned English in the Chinese context for 7e12 years.
They were roughly of intermediate and upper-intermediate levels, or B1 and B2 as described in Common European Framework
of Reference for Languages: Learning, Teaching, Assessment (Council of Europe, 2011). Six students from Tibet and four from
Taiwan were excluded for large variation in their English education background, and four were absent from class during data
collection. Therefore, 92 students were initially included for data screening.
The 92 students were ranked according their ﬁnal writing scores (see Scoring of student writings). The participants for this
study were selected from the high and low ends of the student pool. Those who ranked the top 30 formed the more-skilled
group and those who ranked the bottom 30 formed the less-skilled group. Due to ties in writing scores around the demarca-
tion lines, three more students were dropped to ensure the necessary gap in their writing skill levels. Eventually, there were 28
students in the more-skilled group and 29 in the less-skilled group. Table 1 provides an overview of the two groups, showing
that the two groups, with similar years of English learning and ages, differed signiﬁcantly in their English writing skills.

3.2. Writing task

Data were collected during the 5th week in the fall semester of 2015. Inputlog6.0 was installed on each computer in the
computer lab where participants regularly attended their advanced English course. To prime the students for the study, one
summary and one narration were completed in the computer lab using Inputlog6.0. One week before data collection, the
students had one class reading and discussing a model argumentative essay to get familiar with the genre of argumentation.
During the week of data collection, the teacher ﬁrst provided a 20-min mini-lecture to review the essential academic ele-
ments for argumentation from the last class. Then, the teacher briefed the students on a recent drunk driving case, which
resulted in two immediate deaths and one serious injury. The news was widely covered by local media, arousing much social
concern and discussion over drunk driving. Students were then asked to develop a complete piece of argumentation on whether
drunk drivers should be imprisoned on their ﬁrst offense. As the timed writing task was of 30 min in College English Test, Band 4
(CET4, a nationwide college English proﬁciency test in China), students in this study were asked to ﬁnish the task by taking as
much in-class time as necessary, roughly up to 70 min before class was over. To better track the writing process through
keystroke logging, students were notiﬁed not to draft on paper or elsewhere other than on the computer. Independent samples
t-tests were run on the eventual task time and text lengths of the two groups, and Table 2 presents the results.

3.3. Coding scheme

3.3.1. Revision types
Integrating previous revision taxonomies (Barkaoui, 2016; Stevenson et al., 2006; Thorson, 2000), this study, on basis of
the temporospatial location of the revising event, divided online revisions into three types, i.e., immediate revision, distant
revision and end revision.
Immediate revision was deﬁned as a revising event in which “the distance between the position of the cursor and that of the
revision was zero” (Thorson, 2000, p. 160). Therefore, for immediate revision, the point of revision inscription overlapped
with the point of text production.
Distant revision referred to a revising event in which the point of revision inscription was distant from the point of text
production, as shown by the cursor position being moved away from the production point for the revising event. In addition,
there was further text production following a distant revision.
End revision was a revising event following the completion of the main text, in which the writer reviewed and revised the
produced text. It was operationalized as the last distant revision(s) whose termination was not followed by further production
at the end of the text.

3.3.2. Revision measures
Online revisions were analyzed in terms of frequency, scope, distance and duration. The raw frequency of revisions was
standardized into frequency of a 60-min task to correct for differences in task time: standardized frequency ¼ raw frequency/
task time (seconds)*3600 (seconds). Scope referred to the sum of letters deleted and produced for each distant or end revision.
For immediate revision, scope referred to the number of letters deleted, as the revision point overlapped with the production
point in immediate revision. Distance referred to the number of letters that the cursor moved from the production point to the
revising point and duration was operationalized as the number of seconds a revising event lasted. As immediate revision
happened within one or 2 s at the production point, only frequency and scope were considered for immediate revision.
Though revision scope and duration may naturally correlate with each other in that revisions of larger scopes generally
consume more time than revisions of small scopes, there could be occasions in which some revision operations like block
deletion could happen over seconds but affect the text on large scopes. Therefore, both scope and duration were examined
with frequency and distance to multi-dimensionally denote a revising event.
As Inputlog6.0 logged the writing processes at the millisecond level, a writing task of about 40 min would typically
produce a log ﬁle of 4000e6000 operation items (see Appendix I for an excerpt). To mass process the writing data collected by
Inputlog6.0, a computer script was developed with above deﬁnitions of online revisions to automate the analyses of fre-
quency, scope, distance and duration of immediate, distant and end revisions in each logged writing event.

3.3.3. Scoring of student writings
Student writings were rated using a holistic rating rubric, which measured a text from three aspects, i.e., organization,
content, and language (see Appendix II). The rubric, with a score range of 0e15, was adapted from that of CET4. Two
experienced EFL teachers rated student writings separately. Neither rater taught any of the students before or during data
collection and both had scored CET4 writings over 10 times, with more extensive experiences in English testing and scoring in
classroom settings. All writings were numerically coded to remove student identities before rating and a writing would be
returned to both raters for rescoring if the score discrepancy exceeded three points.
The inter-rater reliability was checked using Pearson correlation coefﬁcients. The initial reliability was r(92) ¼ 0.82
(p ¼ .00) and it reached r(92) ¼ 0.91 (p ¼ .00) after the rescoring to remove score discrepancy over three points. The mean
score of the two raters was used as the ﬁnal score for each writing for grouping and data analyses.

3.4. Statistical analysis

Using SPSS19.0, the multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) was run on immediate, distant and end revisions across the
more- and less-skilled groups to examine whether L2 writing skill signiﬁcantly affected online revisions in written text
composition. The signiﬁcance level was set at 0.05 (2-tailed) and partial h2 was reported for the effect size of the group difference.
Pearson correlation coefﬁcients were computed to examine if the ﬁnal text quality correlated with different types of online
revisions.

4. Results

4.1. Writing skills and online revisions

4.1.1.
Immediate revisions
Table 3 reports the descriptive data of immediate revisions. A one-way MANOVA was run to examine the effect of L2
writing skill on frequency and scope of immediate revisions. The results suggest a statistically signiﬁcant effect of L2 writing
skill on immediate revisions, (F (2, 54) ¼ 5.34, p < .01; Wilk's L ¼ 0.84, partial h2 ¼ 0.17). Follow-up univariate ANOVAs show
that L2 writing skill had signiﬁcant effects on frequency (F (1, 55) ¼ 5.76, p ¼ .02, partial h2 ¼ 0.10) and scope (F (1, 55) ¼ 5.77,
p ¼ .02, partial h2 ¼ 0.10) of immediate revisions. While both groups displayed frequent and small-scoped immediate re-
visions, the more-skilled group revised less frequently but on larger scopes than did the less-skilled group.

4.1.2. Distant revisions
Table 4 summarizes the descriptive data on the four dimensions of distant revisions. The one-way MANOVA test results
reveal a statistically signiﬁcant effect of L2 writing skill on distant revisions (F (4, 52) ¼ 5.14, p < .01; Wilk's L ¼ 0.72, partial

h2 ¼ 0.28). Follow-up univariate ANOVAs further show that, compared with the less-skilled group, the more-skilled group
made less frequent distant revisions (Frequency: F (1, 55) ¼ 6.13, p ¼ .02, partial h2 ¼ 0.10), but revised on signiﬁcantly larger
scopes (Scope: F (1, 55) ¼ 11.99, p ¼ .00, partial h2 ¼ 0.18) and spent signiﬁcantly more time (Duration: F (1, 55) ¼ 5.30, p ¼ .03,
partial h2 ¼ 0.09) on distant revisions. However, the two groups did not differ signiﬁcantly in the distance of distant revisions
(F (1, 55) ¼ 1.88, p ¼ .18 >0 .05).

4.1.3. End revisions
Table 5 displays the descriptive data of end revisions for the two groups. A one-way MANOVA was conducted to examine
the effect of L2 writing skill on end revisions and the results suggest the effect of L2 writing skill was statistically signiﬁcant on
end revisions (F (4, 52) ¼ 4.28, p < .01; Wilk's L ¼ 0.75, partial h2 ¼ 0.25). Follow-up univariate ANOVAs detected signiﬁcant
effects of L2 writing skill on all four measures of end revisions, i.e., frequency (F (1, 55) ¼ 9.23, p ¼ .00, partial h2 ¼ 0.14), scope
(F (1, 55) ¼ 14.59, p ¼ .00, partial h2 ¼ 0.21), distance (F (1, 55) ¼ 5.44, p ¼ .02, partial h2 ¼ 0.09), and duration (F (1, 55) ¼ 16.28,
p ¼ .00, partial h2 ¼ 0.23). Speciﬁcally, the more-skilled group initiated more frequent end revisions, revised on larger scopes,
attended to larger parts of the produced text, and spent more time during end revisions. By contrast, the less-skilled group
less frequently engaged in end revisions, and their end revisions were of smaller scopes and shorter duration, being conﬁned
to smaller parts of their texts.

4.2. Online revisions and the ﬁnal text quality

Pearson correlation coefﬁcients were computed between the three types of online revisions and the ﬁnal text score, and
Table 6 summarizes the results. There observed a negative correlation between the frequency of immediate revision and the
ﬁnal text score, which approached the signiﬁcance level (r(57) ¼  0.25, p ¼ .06), and a signiﬁcant negative correlation be-
tween the frequency of distant revision and the ﬁnal text score (r(57) ¼  0.30, p ¼ .02). However, the frequency of end
revision correlated positively with the ﬁnal text score (r(57) ¼ 0.25, p ¼ .06). This suggests that too frequent revisions during

text production (either immediate or distant revisions) were not conducive to the ﬁnal text quality, but the ﬁnal text quality
beneﬁted from end revision practices after text production.
As shown in Table 6, the ﬁnal text score consistently demonstrated positive correlation with revision scope, be it im-
mediate revision (r(57) ¼ 0.32, p ¼ .01), distant revision (r(57) ¼ 0.45, p ¼ .00) or end revision (r(57) ¼ 0.37, p ¼ .01), sug-
gesting that the ﬁnal text beneﬁted from large-scope revisions. Furthermore, the ﬁnal text score correlated positively with
distant revision duration (r(57) ¼ 0.30, p ¼ .02) and end revision duration (r(57) ¼ 0.38, p ¼ .00), further suggesting that time
spent on distant revisions and end revisions helped improve the ﬁnal text quality. However, there was no signiﬁcant cor-
relation between the ﬁnal text quality and revision distance, either for distant revisions (r(57) ¼ 0.15, p ¼ .27) or end revisions
(r(57) ¼ 0.24, p ¼ .08).

5. Discussion

This study set out to examine to what extent L2 writing skill would affect L2 writers’ online revisions in computer
keyboard settings and how online revisions related to the ﬁnal text quality. While conﬁrming L2 writing proﬁciency
signiﬁcantly affected immediate, distant and end revisions, this study yielded meaningful ﬁndings on several issues in L2
revising: (i) the predominance of linguistic revisions; (ii) the inhibition of local issues on global issues, (iii) the strategic
deference of language concerns and (iv) the inﬂuence of online revisions on the ﬁnal text quality.
First, immediate revision was the predominant revision type for L2 writers both at the more- and less-skilled levels,
lending support to previous ﬁndings that L2 writers mostly engaged in revisions of small scopes (Barkaoui, 2016; Stevenson
et al., 2006). The high frequency and small scope of immediate revisions mark out language proﬁciency an important factor
inﬂuencing ﬂuent text production in L2 writing (Qu, 2017). Previous studies suggest that revising functions to compensate for
L2 writers' lack of language proﬁciency and skilled L2 writers produce more linguistically accurate texts requiring fewer
revisions (Chenoweth & Hayes, 2001; MacArthur, Graham, & Fitzgerald, 2008). This study yet suggests possible differences in
L2 writers’ strategic use of revising to solve language issues. It is observed in this study that many of the more-skilled writers
later engaged in extensive end revisions to tackle language issues but few from the less-skilled group did so, suggesting the
more- and less-skilled L2 writers adopted different revising strategies in L2 writing. While both groups encountered language
difﬁculty in L2 writing, the more-skilled group were apt at focusing on idea development ﬁrst by deferring language concerns
to later stages of writing through end revisions. Together with the fact that the more-skilled group produced much longer
texts within similar amounts of task time, this study suggests language concerns at early stages of writing could lead to
attention conﬂict between production and revision, and consequently result in frequent writing break-downs. This thus
conﬁrms the observation in previous studies that attention to linguistic issues in L2 writing could affect ﬂuent development of
ideas and productive use of task time (Chenoweth & Hayes, 2001; Xu & Ding, 2014).
The second ﬁnding is that when time pressure is low in L2 writing tasks, attention to local issues does not inhibit attention
to global issues, lending no support to the inhibition hypothesis in terms of online revisions in L2 writing. Immediate revisions
suggest a focus on current formulation than the overall text planning or revising (Barkaoui, 2016; Stevenson et al., 2006) and
revision distance denotes how much text L2 writers strive to accommodate in their revision attempt. In this study, the less-
skilled group engaged more frequently both in immediate and distant revisions than the more-skilled group and displayed
similar distance in their distant revisions as the more-skilled group. This demonstrates that less-skilled L2 writers also had
concerns for large-scope issues in their revision attempts and attention to local issues did not impede their attention to
distant and global issues. This is in line with Piolat, Roussey, Olive, and Amada (2004) ﬁnding that L2 writers, when given
more time, were able to engage in different levels of revisions simply by investing more time in the task. In this study, the
more- and less-skilled groups experienced little time pressure as shown by the fact that both groups ﬁnished the task much
ahead of the allowed task time. Therefore, time pressure could be an important factor affecting L2 writers’ revising activities,
and if issues of different scopes do not simultaneously drain their attentional resources, less-skilled L2 writers would also
attend to large-scope issues during text production.
However, the more- and less-skilled L2 writers eventually differed in the scope of distant revisions, suggesting differences
in their competence to solve the identiﬁed writing problems. Dix (2006) suggested rereading and revising the produced text
could be a strategy for writers to re-elaborate, rediscover and reorganize ideas for further text development when their
writing broke down. In this study, while the frequency and distance of distant revisions suggested L2 writers at both levels
exhibited concerns for issues distant away from the production point, the signiﬁcantly longer duration and larger scope of
distant revisions of the more-skilled group testiﬁed to the difference in how successful their distant revision attempts were.
As large-scope revisions can be considered revisions at higher levels (Stevenson et al., 2006), this study suggests that while
both groups tried to revise high-level issues, less-skilled L2 writers were not as successful as their more-skilled peers. In other
words, while demonstrating comparable attention to high-level issues in their distant revision attempts, the less-skilled L2
writers did not display comparable competence in successfully addressing these issues through large-scope revisions. This
ﬁnding conﬁrms L2 writers’ ability for problem detection develops faster than their problem-solving ability (Roca De Larios,
Murphy, & Marín, 2002) and suggests less-skilled L2 writers need to learn how to revise for discovery and elaboration of ideas
to better address the problems detected during L2 writing.
A third ﬁnding of this study is that end revision is an important indicator of writing skill and contributes substantially to
the improvement of the ﬁnal text quality. Unlike immediate or distant revisions which were accompanied with suspension of
text production, end revisions were voluntary revising processes initiated by the writer to review and revise the produced

112

C. Xu / System 78 (2018) 104e114

text under little pressure of further text production. However, even when time permitted, the less-skilled L2 writers did not
engage much in end revision as did their more-skilled peers, demonstrating differences in motivation and strategy use be-
tween the more- and less-skilled L2 writers. Different from previous suggestions that linguistically less competent L2 writers
would revise more while those who were linguistically more competent would produce better texts requiring less revisions
(Chenoweth & Hayes, 2001), this study shows end revision is a proactive investment of efforts to further improve the pro-
duced text rather than a reactive measure to overcome writing breakdowns or to improve poorly-constructed texts.
Therefore, engagement in end revision reﬂects L2 writers' conscious use of revising as a strategy to improve the text before
submission. The fact that less-skilled L2 writers far less frequently engaged in end revisions lent support to the previous
ﬁnding that less-skilled L2 writers were reluctant to reread and revise their produced texts (see Barkaoui, 2007). Under the
limited capacity of working memory during written text production, the strategic use of end revision may help L2 writers free
up their attentional resources from planning, translating and revising simultaneously. While writing is a process where
planning, translating and revising constantly interact in a recursive manner (Hayes & Flower, 1980), this study suggests
setting functionally deﬁned priority for each writing stage could avoid the risk of overloading L2 writers’ working memory
with conceptual development and language issues at the same time.
Last but not least, this study found the ﬁnal text quality correlated negatively with the frequency of immediate and distant
revisions, but positively with the frequency of end revisions, the scope and duration of both distant and end revisions. While
immediate revision and distant revision signal writing difﬁculties during drafting and thus interrupt ﬂuent text production,
end revision demonstrates further effort investment for text improvement after drafting. As L2 writing naturally encounters
lack of language proﬁciency (Qu, 2017), the more-skilled L2 writers lifted this affective inﬂuence by deferring language
concerns to the end revision process. By contrast, the less-skilled L2 writers displayed frequent small-scope immediate and
distant revisions during drafting and did not engage much in end revision even when task time permitted, suggesting a
marked difference in their revising strategies against those of the more-skilled group. The correlations between online re-
visions and the ﬁnal text quality thus collectively suggest that L2 writing beneﬁts from a ﬂuent and focused production
process, scaffolded by in-depth and extensive revisions. While learning to write in L2 entails a robust drive for attainment of
higher language proﬁciency, writing strategies should be promoted to a conscious level to help L2 writers better complete
their writing tasks by prioritizing certain processes over others at different stages of writing (Roca de Larios et al., 2006) and
thus optimize learning from writing.

6. Conclusions and future directions

As Myers (2001) suggests, encouraging student writers to reﬂect on their texts and writing processes helps them identify
their strengths, weaknesses and learning needs in writing. This study, by examining the revising process of the more- and
less-skilled L2 writers through an integrated taxonomy of online revisions, provided enriched understandings of the revising
process and important pedagogical implications for L2 writing.
Firstly, L2 writing inevitably encounters lack of language proﬁciency, and L2 writers should learn to tackle language issues
strategically as language concerns at early stages of writing could impede conceptual development. As effective strategy use is
central to L2 writing (De Silva & Graham, 2015) and strategy instruction can scaffold L2 learning (Plonsky, 2011), this study
suggests L2 writers need to build up their conﬁdence to develop good writings in a foreign language and strategically defer
their language concerns to later stages of writing to prioritize idea development.
Secondly, when time pressure is low in L2 writing, attention to low-level issues does not impede attention to high-level
issues in revising. However, less-skilled L2 writers need practical strategies to tackle large issues and make their revising
attempts successful. Only by scaffolding L2 writers to revise their identiﬁed writing problems could they develop their
problem-solving abilities. Therefore, L2 writers should be pedagogically guided to rediscover, elaborate and integrate ideas in
their revision attempts when their writing breaks down.
Finally, the deference of language concerns and priority for conceptual development in L2 writing make end revision
essential for quality writing. L2 writers need to be pedagogically oriented about the practical aims of each writing stage and
stick to these aims instead of overloading their working memory by juggling too many at a time. While learning to revise can
be “a lengthy, complex endeavor” (Allal, Chanquoy, & Largy, 2004, p.1), end revision helps free up attentional resources to
prioritize production and should be pedagogically promoted in L2 writing as a production and revision strategy.
While enriching our understanding of the L2 revising process, the ﬁndings of this study need to be interpreted with
caution. First, this study only examined online revisions quantitatively from the process perspective, and future studies could
qualitatively probe into the reasons behind online revisions. Second, this study focused on the online revising process in L2
writing without statistically integrating it with other component processes. As writing is a complex integration of various
component processes, future studies can examine revising in conjunction with other processes such as planning, translating
and pausing to better inform the L2 writing pedagogy.
